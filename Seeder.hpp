//A Mode (beacon RRC, Uplink ENC....) is defined by three things:
        //-the transition states and associated functions for event driven logic
        //-the seed (topology, Classes, internals variables) 
        //the activation schedule, that is the same for every nodes in a mode (theCallBack is the same (onTimeChange) but it will call a different stateTransitionFunction)
